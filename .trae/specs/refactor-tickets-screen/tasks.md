# Tasks

- [x] Task 1: Refactor Tickets Screen
  - [x] Replace `StyleSheet` imports with NativeWind classes in `app/(tabs)/tickets.tsx`
  - [x] Update `TIERS` constant to map to semantic Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-gold`, `text-gold`) or keep dynamic styles if necessary
  - [x] Ensure "Transfer" and "Sell" buttons use the correct semantic colors (`surface-highlight`, `surface-error` etc.)

- [x] Task 2: Verify Styling
  - [x] Check that the ticket list layout is preserved
  - [x] Verify that the "minimized" view looks correct
  - [x] Verify that the `TicketModal` still opens correctly
